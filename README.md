This project has been created with in mind the learning process behind working with PyQt signals and slots especially between multiple windows where several could be in between. This project also teached something more about adding Ui elements in a more dynamic way into letting the code figuring it out instead of making the Ui designer parts manually. The project will evolve in between version differences, the goal is to build a minimal viable product and to remove bits from the current state that are not requered for the application to work properly.

The application is capable of:
1) Creating a list of items within both the creator window itself and also in the first launched window.
2) Clearing list items; the process makes sure that the list of created values would be cleared, both designed layouts will be cleaned up after that.
3) Returning back to the first launched window from the third window.

- The windows themselves have navigation in between behind buttons to click on to navigate from first to second to third, eventually back to first.
